= Using a custom layout for your Homepage =

There are two separate methods for applying a custom layouts as your theme's homepage. Which method you use just depends on what you feel is most logical for how you're setting up your homepage.

Method 1: Create your custom layout, apply it to a static page, and then assign that page as your static frontpage under Settings > Reading > Frontpage Displays.

Method 2: Under *Settings > Reading > Frontpage Displays*, select "your latest posts." Create your custom layout. Then, go to *Appearance > Theme Options > Content > Homepage*, and select your new custom layout as the content for the homepage. 

*Note: If you're using an element in your custom layout that uses post pagination, make sure you use method #2.*
