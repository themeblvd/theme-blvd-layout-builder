# Theme Blvd Layout Builder

The [Theme Blvd Layout Builder plugin](https//wordpress.org/plugins/theme-blvd-layout-builder) has provided the content building experience for [Theme Blvd WordPress themes](https://themeblvd.com) since 2012, but is slowly being phased out as we move into the Gutenberg era.

With the release of WordPress 5, the Theme Blvd Layout Builder is getting its last minor update (v2.3) to allow your current setup to continue working. However, with the new editing experience of WordPress 5, this layout builder plugin no longer provides the best editing workflow. And so we'll begin working towards alternate solutions that make more sense with this new era of WordPress.
